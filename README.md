# Best schools add Â£18,600 to average house price

In March 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39327149) on a study by the Department for Education (DfE) which found prices are 8% higher near the best-performing primary schools and 6.8% higher near the best secondary schools.

Recent analysis by Teach First found 43% of pupils at England's outstanding secondary schools were from the wealthiest 20% of families, while a separate study by the Sutton Trust suggested poorer children were much less likely to get places at the schools with the best GCSE results.
